    <p>Missed Harvest was made for a class where the only requirement was that the game must be multiplayer. The idea for Missed Harvest was actually bestowed upon us 
      by a classmate who worked on a different project that quarter. Our original vision for the game included story driven gameplay with levels dipping into multiple genres such as 
      stealth and racing. However, we we're horribly overscoped for an eight week project with only two programmers and we ended up focusing on the platforming and puzzle mechanics. 
      Had I been a better programmer at the time, we may have been able to implement more of our ideas. I think lacking a producer seriously limited our productivity on the project, 
      as we each had our own unfocused picture of what the game should have been.
    </p>
    <p>The main struggle for me on this project was fulfilling the multiplayer requirements. I wanted our game to not just be a game where two people could play, but one where they had to cooperate. 
      I also didn't want to fall into the trap of reusing trending co-op elements. For example: one player can see things and the other can interact. I tried as much as I could to make the puzzles adhere 
      to the farm theme.
