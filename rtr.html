      <p>There's a new metropolitan city on the map. You and other players have capitalized on this opportunity and have each built extravagant casinos. To ensure your casino becomes the 
        most popular, your goal is to be the first to build a road from the airport to your casino.

    <p>Roads to Riches was made for my capstone class. We continued this project from a previous class. The original version was made of paper and was 2 player. 
      Our goals for this project were to make a digital version of the game that was visually polished, had online multiplayer, and additional game modes. Our work on the project began with making a 2D version 
      and we eventually built up to 3D. After a lot of hours sunk by two of our members, we decided to scrap online and focus on polish.
    </p>
    <p>My role in the project consisted mainly of programming. I made the code that generated and stored the board, along with displaying and placing cards. This project taught me a lot about 
      Unity's builtin UI capabilities such as layouts, draggables, and using textures to display videos. I took inspiration from Hearthstone for placing cards and I was pretty happy with how it turned out. 
      Additionally, I was in charge of game modes. We ended up with 2 player, 4 player, and a speed game mode where players had limited time to place a card. If they took more than 5 seconds, they lost a card 
      and their turn. Running out of cards resulted in a loss. This taught me about turn managers and using inheritance to avoid duplicating code for each game mode. Some other small things I made were some 
      animations and particle effects using Unity's animations and particle systems. I also wrote the How to Play page, so I hope the language I used there makes it clear how to play the game.
