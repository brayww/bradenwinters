    <p>Destroy the Dungeon's Core was made in a class about tabletop games. Our project's only constraint was to make a game in Tabletop Simulator. This was my first game 
      project class. Coming into the project, I only had one request: we make a game with character archetypes. However, no one on our team had a pitch. Around this time, 
      I made a new friend that was into Dungeon's and Dragons. I had also recently watched a different friend of mine play Slay the Spire, a roguelike that uniquely has 
      card battling. I fused these two ideas into an elevator pitch and thus we had the basic idea for Destroy the Dungeon's Core.
    </p>
    <p>My role on the team was gameplay designer. I designed the game's objectives, card system, cards, player archetypes, and mobs. We made balance decisions as a team 
      based off feedback from internal and external playtests. The takeaways from this class were how to create a game design document and how to iteratively playtest.
