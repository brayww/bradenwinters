    <p>From the Lonesome Ashes was the first video game I ever made. This project was made for a class, but we had no constraints. 
      My goal for this quarter was to create a first person game in order to learn about first person games in Unity. Our original concept was a mix of souls-like and 
      roguelike, but we had to scrap the roguelike elements due to overscoping. We honed in on a souls-like first person shooter, with an emphasis on movement.
    </p>
    <p>My role on the team was weapons designer. I designed and programmed the game's weapon models, their animations, and their related scripts. For the models and animations, I used Blender. 
      From this project, I learned the difference between making projectile versus hitscan weapons. My biggest regret in this project was how inexperienced I was at the time. Since I was new to 
      coding in game engines, I was scared to take on more tasks. With my current workflow, I could have pushed out a lot more weapons, and I would have contributed more towards enemy design. 
      The key takeaway from this project was learning the ability to teach myself Unity through online resources. This was also the project that sparked my interest in game AI.
